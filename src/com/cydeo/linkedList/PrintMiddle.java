/*
Problem:
• Find the middle of a linked list in one pass. If the list has an even number of
nodes, there would be two middle nodes.
• Note: Assume that you don’t know the size of the list ahead of time.

Slow/Fast Runner Solution Steps:
1. Create two pointers
2. Single jump with a
3. Double jump with b
4. If b==tail print a,
5. If b.next==tail print a & a.next
